# oop-intro

## Description
Through this application, I practiced creating objects using a class as the template. Then I pushed the objects into an array, looping through the array, and printing out each object.

## Usage
Enter a username in the first text field, and a message in the next text field. Click submit to create a message object and add it to the message array. Then check your console log to see that each message object in the message array has been printed.

## Installation
No installation is required to use this application. Simply access via the deployed Github Pages URL: https://elias-j-henry.github.io/oop-intro/
